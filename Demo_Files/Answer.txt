You can use the youtube-transcript-api python package to download the transcript of a YouTube video along with timestamps. This package allows you to get the transcript/subtitles for a given YouTube video. It also works for automatically generated subtitles, supports translating subtitles, and it does not require a headless browser, like other selenium-based solutions do.
Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use this package to download the transcript of a YouTube video along with timestamps:

from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

# Replace the video_id with the id of your desired YouTube video
video_id = "your_video_id"

# Get the transcript for the given video_id
transcript_list = YouTubeTranscriptApi.list_transcripts(video_id)

# Select the transcript that you want to download
transcript = transcript_list.find_transcript(['en'])

# Download the transcript along with timestamps
with open('transcript.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(transcript.to_srt())

In this example, we first import the YouTubeTranscriptApi class from the youtube_transcript_api module. We then replace your_video_id with the id of your desired YouTube video. Next, we use list_transcripts() method to get a list of all available transcripts for the given video. We then select the transcript that we want to download by specifying its language code (in this case, English). Finally, we use to_srt() method to download the transcript along with timestamps in SRT format and write it to a file named transcript.txt.
I hope this helps!
